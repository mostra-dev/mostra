The remote MCP server (WP-30, MC-04): `mostra-runtime server` serves `@mostra/mcp`'s tools at `<apiOrigin>/mcp` over Streamable HTTP behind its authorization server, for the account a token names. Reading tools act on the account's hosted home; `artifact_create`, `artifact_verify`, `artifact_publish` and the workspace's files are relayed to the account's default owner instance (`port/relay.author`), inside its MCP workspace, and answer `MOSTRA_REMOTE_NO_INSTANCE` while none is connected; a publish answers the hosted link. `@mostra/mcp` gains `createAuthorizedEndpoint` and the bundled reference reader (`fileDocs`, `docsIndex`, `topicMarkdown`), which `mostra docs` now uses too.
